JavaScript Quiz

Overview
This is a simple JavaScript-based quiz which mimics authentication and gets instant feedback to the responses from users. It also keeps score and gives you a final score when youâ€™re finished.

Key Features
- Fake Authentication: Access to the quiz is gained by a username prompt.
- Immediate Feedback: Provide instant feedback to users on their answer choices.
- Score Tracking: Scores update in real-time.

Challenges
The biggest challenge was to create the "fake" authentication and to dynamically load questions and feedback when user login. It was also really important to get the score to update correctly with each question on the quiz.

How to Use
1. Enter a username to begin the quiz.
2. Answer the questions, with feedback provided after each selection.
3. View the final score at the end.
